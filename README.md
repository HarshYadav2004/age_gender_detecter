# Age_gender_detecter
# 1. Introduction 

## 1.1 Purpose 

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification for the Age and Gender Detection System using Python and OpenCV. The system will detect a personâ€™s face from a live camera feed or an image and predict the age range and gender of the individual. This project is intended for real-time applications such as demographic analysis, security systems, and automated customer profiling. 

## 1.2 Scope 

This project will: 

Detect faces from a live video feed or a still image. 

Predict the gender (male or female) of the detected person. 

Predict the age group of the person from predefined ranges (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, etc.). 

Display the results on the video or image frame in real-time. 

The system is developed for research, educational, and basic application purposes, focusing on age and gender prediction from faces. 

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations 

OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library used for image processing. 

DNN: Deep Neural Network. 

Python: The programming language used to implement the system. 

Model: A trained machine learning system used to predict age and gender.
